## 🔧 My process

### 🛠️ Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### 📚 What I learned

Working on this project helped me reinforce my understanding of HTML and CSS fundamentals. Here are a few things I learned:

- Implementing responsive design using Flexbox.
- Adding box shadows and borders to elements to enhance their visual appeal.
- Using media queries to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

Here are some code snippets I'm proud of:

```html
<div class="blog-card">
  <img src="./assets/images/blog-image.jpg" alt="Blog preview image" class="blog-image">
  <div class="blog-content">
    <div class="blog-meta">
      <p class="blog-category">Learning</p>
      <p class="blog-date">Published 21 Dec 2023</p>
    </div>
    <h1 class="blog-title">HTML & CSS foundations</h1>
    <p class="blog-description">These languages are the backbone of every website, defining structure, content, and presentation.</p>
    <div class="blog-author">
      <img src="./assets/images/image-avatar.webp" alt="Greg Hooper">
      <p>Greg Hooper</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.blog-card {
  background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  border-radius: 20px;
  border: 2px solid hsl(0, 0%, 7%);
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 1.25);
  max-width: 375px;
  overflow: hidden;
  margin-bottom: 2rem;
}
```

### 🔄 Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on improving my JavaScript skills and learning more about advanced CSS techniques such as CSS Grid and animations. Additionally, I plan to explore more about accessibility to ensure my projects are usable by everyone.
